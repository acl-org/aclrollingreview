title: Announcement for authors and reviewers submitting to January ARR
permalink: /january-arr-announcement
---

From this cycle we intend to strictly monitor adherence to reviewing responsibilities.

All authors will have to register as reviewers or meta-reviewers (Area Chairs-ACs) on ARR. If you are already serving as Senior Area Chair (SAC) this is not necessary.

Papers whose authors have not registered as reviewers or ACs or have not completed their checklists as Reviewers or ACs by the designated deadline will be automatically desk rejected.

Reviewers/ACs who remain unresponsive and do not submit their reviews or meta-reviews on time will be prevented from accessing reviews and/or meta-reviews for their own papers. Further penalties may be incurred, for example by barring submission to a subsequent cycle.

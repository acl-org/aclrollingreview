Add 'AE' for the action editor. This option should be used sparingly, so please only request this in relatively clear circumstances |
| Reviewer/Editor Reassignment Justification | Please specify the reason for any reassignment request. Example reasons include clear lack of expertise in the area or dismissing the work without any concrete comments regarding correctness of the results or argumentation, limited perceived impact of the methods or findings, lack of clarity in exposition, or other valid criticisms. Generally we accept such requests, but the expectation is that papers have been revised based on the earlier reviews and it is up to the discretion of the action editors or editors in chief whether the request is granted.

## Reviewing Schedule

ARR deadlines happen __every 6 weeks__, on the following dates: 1/15, 3/1, 4/15, 6/1, 7/15, 9/1, 10/15, 12/1. In the past, deadlines were on the 15th of each month, but as described in [this blog post](https://aclrollingreview.org/six-week-cycles/), the change took place after the Apr 15th, 2022 deadline.

The reason why the schedule is tight is because we aspire to make turnaround as quick as possible so that authors can get timely feedback on their papers to make further revisions and make them better, or submit to appropriate conferences. In the case that all reviews and meta-reviews are completed on time, reviews will be released 6 weeks after the submission deadline. In the case that not all reviews are completed on time, the release of reviews may be later than this date (either slightly or substantially).

<!-- You can add these dates to your own calendar by subscribing to or downloading [this shared Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=dsa7ntvq7s9fah2f5e43tncmu8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York). -->

## Submission to Participating Venues

Any paper that is not desk rejected will receive reviews. Once authors have reviews they may:
- revise and resubmit for another round of reviews (typically papers will go back to the same action editor and reviewers)
- submit their paper *and reviews* to a publication venue

Current publication venues participating in ARR are listed below. If you represent a publication venue and would like to be added to this list, please see [this page](https://aclrollingreview.org/organizers).
